# Introduction

Our research project focus on indoor positioning (IPS)  subject.
We want to discuss about:

•	How indoor positioning work.

•	 Devices and method that we can use to receive individual location inside a closed facility.

•	Our new ideas to receive indoor positioning.

•	Companies that offers IPS services.

•	success and failures that occurred along the way.


As a sub research we decided to try to solve the problem of finding the shortest route for a customer inside the supermarket.
Like the “Waze” application we read about the traveling salesman problem to first understand how to receive a solution that answer the supermarket problem:
“Given a list of products and distances between each pair of supermarket’s 
departments \ products what is the shortest possible route that visits each department exactly once and returns to the entrance of the supermarket".
we also want to help customers by offering products on sale in their close location in the supermarket.

The purpose of the online shopping system is to ease shopping management and to create a convenient and easy-to-use application for customers, trying to buy products at the grocery store.
The system is based on both database with its products, a smart mapping system and shortest path algorithm.
